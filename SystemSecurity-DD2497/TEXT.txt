Build the project using realesetools
Boot Minix
Login as root
Create a user(user add -m XXXX)
Set password(passwd XXXX)
Create another user(user add -m XXXX2)
Set password(passwd XXXX2)
Logout(exit)
Login as the new user

Create a text file(echo plaintext > file)
Dump the content(cat file)
Logout(exit)
Login as the second user
Go to the home directory of the other user(cd ../XXXX)
Dump the content(cat file)

At this point two things must have happened. During the first
file dump the original content is shown but after the second,
a slight difference must be present.
The difference is generally small because the the uids are
generated in an incremental fashion(e.g. 1000 vs 1001).

example1: user1: aaaa, user2: aaa`
example2: user1: 123456789, user2: 123556799
