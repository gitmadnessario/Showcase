# AdvHCI + HCI
AdvHCI(564): Design and development of interactive applications for a smart conference room. The applications are designed to run on smartphones/tablets a PC and a Big Screen with the aid of Kinect(C#), pressure sensors and voice recognition. The online interface of the applications make use of HTML, Bootstrap and AngularJS. Colleagues attending remotely communicate with the ones present in the meeting via a chat system.

HCI(464) : Design and implementation of an online Course and Assignments management service (like elearn). The user logs in to his account, adds/removes courses and teams, inspects his history(commits, grades) along with grading the courses(for their difficulty). The user is also able to leave a comment so other users can assess (with the grading) the difficulty of the course.(JS,HTML,CSS)

# Security analysis of an autonomous vehicle ecosystem
  The report contains a thorough investigation on the security vulnerabilities that can exist in the ecosystem of autonomous vehicles and their backend infrastructure. To achieve this, the goals of the company along with the potential damages are taken into account; the possible adversaries, and their capabilities, are quantified in order to provide a complete risk assesment. Certain vulnerabilities are identified and their feasibility is measured against the appropraite mitigation techniques. In the end, a comprehensive course of action is proposed based on the cost and the deployment time of those defensive mechanisms.

# Master Thesis
  My master thesis involved the investigation of network and jamming attacks on vehicular platoons and Cooperative Adaptive Cruside Control. New vehicle maneuvers were implemented, in order to further tests our attacks, a defensive mechanism was employed to test its feasibility and its shortcomings, and the rationality of the attacker was taken into account when evaluating the potency of the attacks.

# Live replication module (permission granted)
  The following feature was developped during my time as a Backend Developer at Omnixell.
  - Reverse engineered the couchDB replication scheme and transformed it into an agnostic live replication protocol that can handle pouchDB, mongoDB, couchDB and Magento in order to enable a seamless offline/online experience to the client applications.
  - Caching system implemented in redis to handle the different backend infrastructures.
